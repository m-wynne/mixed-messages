#Mixed Messages
##Project Description
Mixed Messages is a very simple app designed to simulate a broken computer system upon a spaceship.
Every time a user runs the code, a randomised message from the ship's computer is logged.
##Technologies
This app is written entirely in JavaScript and is designed to run inside the console, either on browser or through node.js.
